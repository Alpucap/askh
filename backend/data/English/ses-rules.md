# -S/-ES Rules

These rules apply to both **Plural Nouns** (One cat, two cats) and **Present Simple Verbs** (I watch, He watches).

## General Rule (+s)

**Commonly used for:** The majority of English words that do not have special endings.

**Simply:** Just add "s"

**Rule:** Add -s to the end of the word

**Examples:**
- (Noun) Cat → Cats
- (Noun) File → Files
- (Verb) Work → Works
- (Verb) Play → Plays

## Words Ending in -ch, -sh, -s, -ss, -x, or -z (+es)

**Commonly used for:** Words that end in a "hissing" sound. Adding "es" makes it easier to pronounce (adds a syllable).

**Simply:** If it hisses, add "es"

**Rule:** Add -es

**Examples:**
- (Noun) Box → Boxes
- (Noun) Class → Classes
- (Verb) Watch → Watches
- (Verb) Fix → Fixes

---

## Words Ending in Consonant + y (-ies)

**Commonly used for:** When a word ends in a consonant (b, d, r, l, etc.) followed by "y"

**Simply:** Remove Y, add IES

**Rule:** Change "y" to "i" + add -es

**Examples:**
- (Noun) City → Cities
- (Noun) Story → Stories
- (Verb) Try → Tries
- (Verb) Study → Studies

---

## Words Ending in Vowel + y (+s)

**Commonly used for:** When a word ends in a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) followed by "y". The vowel protects the "y" from changing.

**Simply:** Keep Y, just add S

**Rule:** Add -s

**Examples:**
- (Noun) Day → Days
- (Noun) Key → Keys
- (Verb) Buy → Buys
- (Verb) Enjoy → Enjoys

---

## Words Ending in Consonant + o (+es)

**Commonly used for:** Many standard nouns ending in "o"

**Note:** There are exceptions like "photos" or "pianos"

**Simply:** O gets ES

**Rule:** Add -es

**Examples:**
- (Noun) Potato → Potatoes
- (Noun) Hero → Heroes
- (Verb) Go → Goes
- (Verb) Do → Does

## Words Ending in -f or -fe (-ves)

**Commonly used for:** Nouns ending in "f" sounds. The sound vibrates to "v" in the plural.

**Simply:** F becomes V

**Rule:** Change "f" or "fe" to "v" + add -es

**Examples:**
- (Noun) Life → Lives
- (Noun) Leaf → Leaves
- (Noun) Wife → Wives
- **Exception:** Roof → Roofs
